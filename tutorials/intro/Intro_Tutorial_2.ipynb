    "In this part of the tutorial, we will write **labeling functions** which express various heuristics, patterns, and [_weak supervision_](http://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/weak_supervision.html) strategies to label our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most real-world settings, hand-labeled training data is prohibitively expensive and slow to collect. A common scenario, though, is to have access to tons of _unlabeled_ training data, and have some idea of how to label it programmatically. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may be able to think of text patterns that would indicate two people mentioned in a sentence are married, such as seeing the word \"spouse\" between the mentions.\n",
    "* We may have access to an external _knowledge base (KB)_ that lists some known pairs of married people, and can use these to heuristically label some subset of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our labeling functions will capture these types of strategies. We know that these labeling functions will not be perfect, and some may be quite low-quality, so we will _model_ their accuracies with a generative model, which Snorkel will help us easily apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ultimately produce a single set of **noise-aware training labels**, which we will then use to train an end extraction model in the next notebook.  For more technical details of this overall approach, see our [NIPS 2016 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723)."

    "# Creating and Modeling a Noisy Training Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Our biggest step in the data programming pipeline is the creation - _and modeling_ - of a noisy training set.  We'll approach this in three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating labeling functions (LFs):** This is where most of our development time would actually go into if this were a real application. Labeling functions encode our heuristics and weak supervision signals to generate (noisy) labels for our training candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Applying the LFs:** Here, we actually use them to label our candidates!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training a generative model of our training set:** Here we learn a model over our LFs, learning their respective accuracies automatically. This will allow us to combine them into a single, higher-quality label set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also add some detail on how to go about _developing labeling functions_ and then _debugging our model_ of them to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Creating Labeling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Snorkel, our primary interface through which we provide training signal to the end extraction model we are training is by writing **labeling functions (LFs)** (as opposed to hand-labeling massive training sets).  We'll go through some examples for our spouse extraction task below.\n",
    "\n",
    "A labeling function is just a Python function that accepts a `Candidate` and returns `1` to mark the `Candidate` as true, `-1` to mark the `Candidate` as false, and `0` to abstain from labeling the `Candidate` (note that the non-binary classification setting is covered in the advanced tutorials!).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next stages of the Snorkel pipeline, we'll train a model to learn the accuracies of the labeling functions and trewieght them accordingly, and then use them to train a downstream model. It turns out by doing this, we can get high-quality models even with lower-quality labeling functions. So they don't need to be perfect! Now on to writing some:"
